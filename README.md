# IFES Data Scraper

No database of up-to-date election dates exist in an easily accessible format. This codebase scrapes the [IFES Election Guide](https://www.electionguide.org/countries/)
to retrieve all countries' entries. I've also included the final csv file.

For another source with results see [Psephos by Adam Carr](http://psephos.adam-carr.net/).
